Animal Rescue
=============
The goal of this app is to connect
animal lover with animal in distress
(urgent adoption, abandoned, injured, abuse)

By allowing the app user to post a Rescue Beacon
with image, text and geo-location.

Any app user nearby will immediately receive a push notification
informing them that there is an animal in need of help nearby

This app shall also serve as a platform
for non-profit animal rescue organisation 
to communicate with potential rescuer and adopter

The organisation will be shown as Official Account/Channel
for the App user to subsribe.
